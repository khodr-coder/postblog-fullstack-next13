# postblog-fullstack-next13
This is a simple post app built in Next.js13 using PostgreSQL Primsa and Typescript 

This is an EXPERIMENTAL [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app@latest --experimental-app
`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). There was some functionality / compatability mishaps I needed to work through in order to get it working properly. Which is fine, It's still in beta. 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

I have incorporated `GET` and `POST` routes just to start out.
